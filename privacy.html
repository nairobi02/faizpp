      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

      <p>This is the privacy policy page for Crypto Tracker. Here, we outline how we collect, use, and protect your
        personal information when you use our app.</p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

      <p>In brief: We are Crypto Tracker Inc. ("Crypto Trakcer," "we" or "us"). We respect your privacy and work hard to
        protect the confidentiality of information that you give us. We will share your personal data with third parties
        only in the event that itâ€™s needed for the provision of services and data you have requested (explained in
        detail in this privacy policy).</p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <p>Clarify how the collected information is used. For example, mention that personal information is used to
        provide requested services, personalize user experience, send newsletters or promotional emails (with opt-out
        options), and improve the website's functionality.</p>

      <h2>Sharing Your Information</h2>

      <p> Inform users about any third parties or service providers with whom the collected data may be shared. Explain
        the purposes for sharing, such as analytics, advertising, or processing payments. Emphasize that you do not sell
        or disclose personal information to unrelated third parties without explicit consent.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>

      <p>Explain the measures in place to protect user information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
        destruction. Mention the use of encryption, secure server connections, and regular security assessments. Inform
        users that while you take reasonable precautions, no method of transmission over the internet is entirely
        secure.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
